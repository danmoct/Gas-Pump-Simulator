# Gas Pump Simulator

## Description
This was the final project for my Systems Architecture class while in Graduate School.  The main motivation for the project was to create a software application whose architecture would contain a platform independent design, ensuring the application could be reusable, maintainable, extensible and robust.  Through the use of Design Patterns, MDA-EFSM (Model Driven Architecture- Extended Finite State Machine) and UML diagrams, the application was built with low-coupled, highly-cohesive parts that allow for multiple configurations of a gas pump, such as: pumping in gallons or liters; paying with cash, debit or credit; and printing or displaying a receipt.
